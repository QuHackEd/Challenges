# Challenges
 Repository for Challenges for Quantum Hackathon Edinburgh (QuHackEd) July 22-25 July 2019.

Decide among your team how best to manage time. 
There will likely not be enough time for everyone to solve every challenge, plus attempt the 'creative' problem, 
so choose wisely. We recommend that you finish with the predefined challenges by around lunchtime/1, so you have a few hours to work on the 'creative' problem


All Participants
----------------------------------------
Begin with the challenges which do **not** start with the prefix 'advanced'. Once you have gotten a handle on these, 
move on to some of the more advanced ones. For the more advanced participants, it is recommended you do at least the initial ones as well, to get familiar with the PyQuil syntax and Python.

Challenges
-----------------------------------------
When you have completed a notebook, **ONE TEAM MEMBER** should send the .ipynb file to quhacked.info@ed.ac.uk with your team name.
You do **not** need to complete the optional challenges before you send the notebook in.
We will have a leaderboard for the fastest teams, and the teams that complete the most amount of challenges will receive **kudos** (but no prize)


Creative Challenge
--------------------------------------------------
As a guideline, you can choose something from the review paper Brian presented on Monday, and implement it. The review paper is here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07682. Brian's slides (and most of the other presenters) can be found on the QuHackEd website here: https://www.quhacked.com/speakers.

You **do not** have to implement something related to QML, you could do an extension of some of the challenges (but beware this may lose points for originality) or anything else you are comfortable with. 

The only requirement is that you must make a 10 minute presentation tomorrow on what you have done for the 'creative' challenge.
Prizes will be given out for the presentation and team that impresses the judging panel the most.

You have all been allocated a number.
-------------------------------------------------------
At regular intervals, we will be generating a random number by simulating a quantum measurement on the Rigetti simulator, and the lucky winner will receive a piece of Rigetti Swag.
